First, you create your branch locally:

명령어 ex) git checkout -b testBranch
##git checkout -b <branch-name>

The remote branch is automatically created when you push 
it to the remote server. So when you feel ready for it, 
you can just do:

명령어 ex) git push testtest testBranch
##git push <remote-name> <branch-name>

Where <remote-name> is typically origin, 
the name which git gives to the remote you cloned from. 
Your colleagues would then just pull that branch, 
and it's automatically created locally.

##git push <remote-name> <local-branch-name>:<remote-branch-name>


So that a subsequent git pull will know what to do, you might instead want to use:

명령어
##git push -u <remote-name> <local-branch-name>
